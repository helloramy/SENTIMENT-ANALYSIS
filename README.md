## Purpose
In this project, we embark on an exciting and intriguing journey to leverage on the power of pre-trained Deep Learning models provided by Hugging Face. Our goal is to fine-tune these models on a new dataset, tailoring them for a specific taskâ€”predicting sentiment expressed in Tweets. The sentiments we aim to capture include neutral, positive, and negative tones.
